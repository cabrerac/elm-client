# eXplainable Learning Models - Client

This project builds a client for the eXplainable Learning Models (XLM) system.

The XLM system parametrises learning models using a Data-Oriented Architecture. The system also offers a question/answering interface where users can ask about the parametrisation process 
of the learning model using natural language.
